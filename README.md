# What Did I Learn? 

- In order to do animations, you have to instantiate what you want to do using @keyframes 
- :before -> the element is farthest away from the screen. :after goes on top of :before. (Like layers, before is the farest layer)
- border-radius
  - If you want the element to be more rounded (elliptical/circular) => use % for value
  - More pill shaped => use px or em
    - Why? 
      If you use pixel/em, it reduces the radii of the circle to half the size when the curvers overlap
      % is calculating the % of the element's height and width
